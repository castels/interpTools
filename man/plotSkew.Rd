\title{Aggregate and plot the skewness statistics over all simulations}
\usage{
plotSkew(agEval, cptwise = F, symmetric = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{agEval}{A list object (result of agEval.R) of aggregated performance metrics}

\item{cptwise}{logical; Whether to display plots individually (histograms) or together as a density plot}

\item{symmetric}{logical; TRUE = Display only symmetric criteria, FALSE = Display only asymmetric criteria, NULL = Display all criteria}
}
\description{
Function to display the sampling distributions of the skewness statistics for each criterion across all simulations. 
Sampling distributions with a sample mean roughly centered at zero indicate that on average the criterion has a reliably 
symmetric distribution.  Distributions of skewness values whose center is not in the neighbourhood of zero (-s/3 <= Xbar <= s/3) indicate that 
on average the criterion has a skewed distribution, and the median will better capture the essence of the data.
